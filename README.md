# DnD Webapp
This project is to assists in my continued learning of developing more complex applications. I decided to take my console DnD character generator and turn it into a simple webapp. I am building the backend using Flask and the frontend with React. This will then be hosted upon completion to a server I am setting up.

***Project currently under progress, mainly on front-end.***

***Issue with script activating venv, but not running Flask. Will need to be activated manually.***
*_CD into "api" folder and type "flask run" into command line._*

## RUNNING:
1) cd into dnd-char-gen
2) type yarn start
3) Project will automatically open up after scripts have ran. 

### INFO:
- **Languages**: Python and Javscript
- **Frameworks**: React, Flask, and BootStrap
