# DnD Webapp
This project is to assists in my continued learning of developing more complex applications. I decided to take my console DnD character generator and turn it into a simple webapp. I am building the backend using Flask and the frontend with React. This will then be hosted upon completion to a server I am setting up.

***Project currently under progress, mainly on front-end. Place holders indicate where future features will go.***

## RUNNING:
1) cd api/venv/Scripts
2) type "source activate"
3) cd back to api and type "flask run" (activates backend)
4) cd into dnd-char-gen
5) type "npm install" to get packages
6) type npm start
7) Project will automatically open up after scripts have ran. 

### INFO:
- **Languages**: Python and Javscript
- **Frameworks**: React, Flask, and React-BootStrap
